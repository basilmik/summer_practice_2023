On the day he lost his right foot, Walter Van Brunt had been haunted, however haphazardly, by ghosts of the past. 
It began in the morning, when he woke to the smell of potato pancakes, a smell that reminded him of his mother, dead of sorrow after the Peterskill riots of 1949, 
and it carried through the miserable lunch break he divided between nostalgic recollections of his paternal grandmother and a liverwurst 
sandwich that tasted of dead flesh and chemicals. Over the whine of the lathe that afternoon he was surprised by a waking dream of his grandfather, 
a morose, big-bellied man so covered with hair he could have been an orge out of a children's tale, and then, just before five, 
he had a vague rippling vision of a leering Dutchman in sugarloaf hat and pantaloons.
